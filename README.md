Theory: A variable can store a specific sort of data called a data type. A Boolean variable, for instance, may include boolean data, whereas an integer variable may contain integer data. Different Data types are: 1.Integer: int data = 1526; 2.Character: char ch = 's'; 3. Boolean : bool is_true = true; 4. Float : float val = 15.26; 5.Double : double val = 2019.1526;

Input - Output : The cout is used in conjunction with stream insertion operator (<<) to display the output on a console. The cin is used in conjunction with stream extraction operator (>>) to read the input from a console. The endl is a predefined object of ostream class. It is used to insert a new line characters and flushes the stream.
